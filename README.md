## Introduction

To build this web-application, I used the following programming languages: 

 - CSS, 
 - HTML and 
 - Javascript,
 
and the following tools: 

 - git, 
 - npm (6.13.7), 
 - webpack, 
 - babel and 
 - react.

I used the JavaScript tools only to bundle different files and generate static assets representing the different modules/components of the web-application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
